## Introduction

This project is a Ticketing System developed for the Durban University of Technology (DUT). It allows both Staff and Students to create queries that the Support Team will handle and respond to.

## Application Overview

DUT approached us with a request to build a Ticketing System for their institution. The system enables easy management and response to queries for both the Support Team and end users. Key functionalities include:

- Users can create a ticket.
- Users can view only their own tickets.
- User and Staff access is restricted to their respective web pages.
- Microsoft Login for enhanced security.
- Support Team Members have access to all tickets and can respond efficiently.

- Easy ticket creation using a user-friendly template.
- Instant notification upon ticket creation.
- Ability to view and manage tickets.
